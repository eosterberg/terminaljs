# TerminalJs <sup><sub><sub>v0.2.3 — 20190326°0111</sub></sub></sup>

terminal.js by Erik Österberg is a dead simple JavaScript library for emulating a shell environment.

_The present flavour is a derivative by Norber C. Maier 2019. The changes are :_
- _Beep file is embedded (IE >=10)_
- _Some cursor cosmetics_
- _Minified version created with Google Closure Compiler_

### Initialization

    var myTerminal = new Terminal(id)

### Properties and methods

    .html
This is the top DOM element of the terminal instance. If you want to modify styling via CSS, all instances belong to a .Terminal class. The element will also get the ID from the constructor argument.

    .print(message)
Prints the message on a new line.

    .input(message, callback)
Prints the message, and shows a prompt where the user can write. When the user presses enter, the callback function fires. The callback takes one argument, which is the user input.

    .password(message, callback)
The same as input but the input of the user will be hidden just like an old-fashioned terminal.

    .confirm(message, callback)
Displays a confirm message, with a " (y/n)" automatically appended at the end. The callback receives the yes/no value as a boolean.

    .clear()
Clears the screen.

    .sleep(milliseconds, callback)
Works exactly like the JavaScript "setTimeout" function. Waits for the number of milliseconds given, then executes the callback.

    .beep()
Plays a retro digital tone.

    .setTextSize()
    .setTextColor()
    .setBackgroundColor()
    .setWidth()
    .setHeight()
All the ".set" methods accepts any CSS-compliant value.

    .blinkingCursor(boolean)
Set to true by default.
